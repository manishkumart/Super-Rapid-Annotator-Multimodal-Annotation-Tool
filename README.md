Welcome to the **Super Rapid Annotator** project! This tool is designed for video annotation by leveraging advanced multimodal vision and language models. üöÄ

## üìö Problem Statement

Annotating videos, especially identifying specific entities and their temporal relationships, is a complex and time-consuming task. Traditional methods lack efficiency and accuracy, particularly in handling multiple videos simultaneously. Our Super Rapid Annotator addresses these challenges by integrating state-of-the-art multimodal models with sophisticated spatial-temporal analysis, streamlining the annotation process.

## Updated Setup 2.0 - 20 Aug 2024

We have updated the model to **MiniCPM-V 2.6** which is a multimodal large language model (MLLM) designed for vision-language understanding. This model accepts images, videos, and text as inputs and generates high-quality text outputs. Since February 2024, five versions of the model have been released, focusing on **strong performance and efficient deployment**.

**Model:** [MiniCPM-V 2.6 ü§ó](https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM-V-2_6) | [Demo ü§ñ](https://huggingface.co/spaces/openbmb/MiniCPM-V-2_6)

Currently, the model and its dependencies are hosted on Gradio Hugging Face.

## Project Evolution

### Initial Approach

Initially, the approach was to combine a vision-language large language model (VLLM) to process videos and a smaller LLM like Phi to structure the outputs. This method worked well for processing a single video. However, when processing multiple videos in batches, having two LLMs in the pipeline introduced excessive context, making the LLM prone to hallucinations.

### Refined Approach

To address this, the constraints of using two LLMs were removed, focusing solely on using the VLLM for both video processing and output structuring. The key challenges faced during this refinement are outlined below.

### Batch Video Processing Challenges

1. **Video Length and Frame Extraction**: Each video was 4 seconds long. Processing 300 videos amounted to 1200 seconds (20 minutes) of video, with each video containing an average of 80 frames. To efficiently process this, we extracted 15-20 random frames from the beginning to the end of the video. These frames were stitched together into a single image, making it easier to understand the video's nuances.

    [Example Video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30f3537e-3608-4de1-9c44-c8ee90a22ac2)

    The above video can be translated into 16 frames stitched into a grid format:

    ![Stitched Frames](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf4c6ca8-0e14-4eec-98a0-d00703f8576a)

    While this approach worked for some videos, it did not capture all the details. Since limiting the frames to just 16 didn't yield appropriate results, the focus shifted to processing the videos as they are. After each video, the GPU was freed up for batch processing, solving the batch processing issue. The next challenge was structuring the outputs.


### Structuring the Outputs

Previously, we used a Pydantic class to process outputs with another LLM in the pipeline. With the removal of the second LLM, the functionality could still be retained, but research showed that using HTML tags was a more efficient approach. With minimal prompting, it became easier to pass content within HTML tags. For example:

```bash
Prompt: Provide the results in <annotation> tags, where 0 indicates False, 1 indicates True, and None indicates that no information is present. Follow the examples below:
        <annotation>indoors: 0</annotation>
        <annotation>standing: 1</annotation>
        <annotation>hands.free: 0</annotation>
        <annotation>screen.interaction_yes: 0</annotation>
```

Parsing the responses from these tags was simplified using the following Python function:

```python
def parse_string(string, tags):
    """
    Extracts the content between the specified HTML tags from the given string.
    Args:
        string (str): The input string to search for the tag content.
        tags (list): A list of HTML tags to search for.
    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary with tags as keys and lists of content as values.
    Example:
        >>> parse_string("<code>Hello, World!</code><note>Important</note>", ["code", "note"])
        {'code': ['Hello, World!'], 'note': ['Important']}
    """
    results = {}
    
    for tag in tags:
        pattern = rf"<{tag}>(.*?)</{tag}>"
        matches = re.findall(pattern, string, re.DOTALL)
        results[tag] = matches if matches else None

    return results
```

With this update, all the required fields were successfully extracted and processed into a dataframe.

## Evaluation on the Training Dataset

Evaluating the accuracy of each annotation using the best-performing model revealed that LLMs are proficient at understanding body posture (standing/sitting) and location (indoors/outdoors) annotations. However, they often fail to validate the other two annotations, as depicted in the table below.

## üìë Findings and Insights

### Motivation
At Red Hen Labs, through Google Summer of Code, I am contributing to vertical growth by developing an annotation product for the video space using large language models. This approach ensures that we build effective, domain-specific applications rather than generic models.

### Importance of Structuring Models
We cannot always use models out of the box; hence, we must structure them well to achieve the desired outputs. Following the recommendations from the mentors, my first step is to test the capabilities of Video Large Language Models by annotating the following four key entities among many others:

1. **Screen Interaction**: Determine if the subject in the video is interacting with a screen in the background.
2. **Hands-Free**: Check if the subject‚Äôs hands are free or if they are holding anything.
3. **Indoors**: Identify whether the subject is indoors or outdoors.
4. **Standing**: Observe if the subject is sitting or standing.

### The Journey Ahead
We are in an era where new open-source models emerge monthly, continuously improving. This progress necessitates focusing on developing great products around these models, which involve vertical scaling, such as fine-tuning models for specific domains. This approach not only optimizes the use of existing models but also accelerates the development of practical and effective solutions.

### Dataset Preview
Here is a glimpse of the news dataset that we will be annotating, showcasing the real-world application of our annotation models.

### Video Frames and Key Entities
All of the video frames we analyzed are sourced from news segments, each lasting approximately 4‚Äì5 seconds. To accurately capture the main key entities from these models, I have extensively experimented with prompt engineering, employing multiple variations and different models. The most effective prompt, yielding outstanding results, is provided below.

### The Golden Prompt
For each question, analyze the given video carefully and base your answers on the observations made.

1. Examine the subject‚Äôs right and left hands in the video to check if they are holding anything like a microphone, book, paper (white color), object, or any electronic device, try segmentations and decide if the hands are free or not.
2. Evaluate the subject‚Äôs body posture and movement within the video. Are they standing upright with both feet planted firmly on the ground? If so, they are standing. If they seem to be seated, they are seated.
3. Assess the surroundings behind the subject in the video. Do they seem to interact with any visible screens, such as laptops, TVs, or digital billboards? If yes, then they are interacting with a screen. If not, they are not interacting with a screen.
4. Consider the broader environmental context shown in the video‚Äôs background. Are there signs of an open-air space, like greenery, structures, or people passing by? If so, it‚Äôs an outdoor setting. If the setting looks confined with furniture, walls, or home decorations, it‚Äôs an indoor environment.

By taking these factors into account when watching the video, please answer the questions accurately.
